`--target=<target>` is not a switch of the runner, but a [custom switch](#custom-switches) which scripts often implement to invoke a specific task.
:::

## Custom switches

All switches not recognized by Cake will be added to an argument list that is passed to the build script.
See [Arguments And Environment Variables](/docs/writing-builds/args-and-environment-vars#arguments) how to read arguments in your script.
