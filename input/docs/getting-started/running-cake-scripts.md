There are different runners available for running Cake scripts.

# .NET Core Tool

:::{.alert .alert-info}
This is the recommended way to run Cake Scripts.
:::

The [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool) NuGet package, is a .NET Core global tool compiled for .NET Core 2.1 or newer.

For bootstrapping .NET Core Tool see [Bootstrapping .NET Core Tool](bootstrapping-scripts#bootstrapping-for.net-core-tool).

# Cake Frosting

[Cake.Frosting](https://github.com/cake-build/frosting) is a .NET host which allows you to write your build scripts as a console application
(`netcoreapp3.1` or `net461`).

:::{.alert .alert-info}
A console application has the advantage of full IDE support, like IntelliSense, refactoring and debugging.

For bootstrapping Cake Frosting see [Bootstrapping for Cake Frosting](bootstrapping-scripts#bootstrapping-for-cake-frosting).

# Cake runner for .NET Framework

The [Cake](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake) NuGet package is a runner requiring [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
or newer on Windows and Mono `5.12.0` or newer on Mac or Linux.

:::{.alert .alert-warning}
It is suggested to use [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework/net472) or newer to run build scripts
which are using addins targeting .NET Standard 2.0 only.
:::

This runner is mainly for backwards compatibility where scripts or addins are used which require .NET Framework.
In all other cases it is recommended to use [.NET Core Tool](#net-core-tool).

For bootstrapping Cake runner for .NET Framework see [Bootstrapping for Cake runner for .NET Framework](bootstrapping-scripts/#bootstrapping-for-cake-runner-for-net-framework).

# Cake runner for .NET Core

The [Cake.CoreCLR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.CoreCLR) NuGet package is a runner compiled for .NET Core 2.0.

:::{.alert .alert-warning}
The Cake runner for .NET Core is deprecated and it is suggested to use [.NET Core Tool](#net-core-tool) for running Cake under .NET Core.
