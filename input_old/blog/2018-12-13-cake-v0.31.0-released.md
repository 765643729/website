Version 0.31.0 of Cake has been released.

In this version we've got quite a few new features, improvements and fixes.  A full list of changes is at end of this post, but first there's a few we would like to highlight.


## Globber improvements

Cake's built-in globber has gone through a major overhaul, with several improvements.  A few notable ones are:

* Bracket wildcard
  - Specific: `ba[rz]` that matches _"bar"_ or _"baz"_
  - Ranges: `ba[a-zA-z]` or `ba[1-3]` that matches _"baa"_ or _"ba1"_, among others
* Brace expansion: `foo{bar,baz}` that would match _"foobar"_ and _"foobaz"_
* Negation in bracket wildcards (i.e `[!Cc]at` that would match _"bat"_ but not _"cat"_ or _"Cat"_)
* Support for UNC paths

**Example usage:**

```csharp
FilePathCollection files = GetFiles($"./folder/fooba[rz].txt");

DirectoryPathCollection directories = GetDirectories($"./folder/fooba[rz]");
```


## .NET Core Mono fallback on Unix

Full .NET Framework tools will usually execute fine on Windows even if running under .NET Core, but they'll fail on Unix systems.  They don't know what to do with .NET Framework executables. With this release, Cake will inspect if tools with `.exe` extension have a proper .NET Framework PE header and then try to execute it with Mono if available.

This means that you'll be able to use .NET Framework tools even if you're using [Cake.CoreCLR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.CoreCLR) or [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool) running under .NET Core, if you have Mono installed.


## Version & Info arguments

The `--version` argument has changed to only output the Semantic Version of Cake i.e. `0.31.0`, or `0.31.0-alpha0095`, for a pre release.
This will make it easier to check and verify available Cake version in scripts and bootstrappers.

You can still get the previous output by using the `--info` argument. 


## NuGet 4.9.2

Cake has been updated to use version 4.9.2 of the NuGet client libraries, which has several fixes, especially around performance and signed packages.
