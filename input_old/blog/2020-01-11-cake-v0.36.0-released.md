Version 0.36.0 of Cake has been released.

A new year, a new release, this marks the first Cake release for 2020, a release packed with several features, improvements and fixes, full details of contents of this release at end of blog post.

As always a huge thanks to our awesome community! This project wouldn't be sustainable without your contributions and feedback❤

A big focus in this release has been in improved .NET Core 3 runtime support and better handling of native dependencies like i.e. SQL Server client.

We're also very happy to welcome [Jérémie Desautels](https://github.com/Jericho) as a new Cake core team member! His contributions to the Cake ecosystem have been invaluable, especially his work with [Cake.AddinDiscoverer](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.AddinDiscoverer) which inventories new addins and makes sure existing ones follow best practices. This ensures a healthier, more robust and high quality experience for you as a Cake user. It also ensures better discoverability as new addins will now automatically generate a pull request to our website to be documented, addins unlisted from NuGet will automatically generate a pull request for removal from the site and a full audit report is published to [cake-contrib/Home](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Home/blob/master/Audit.md) repo.
