Version 0.30.0 of Cake has been released.

With this release we've got several improvements and bug fixes contributed from the community, so firstly big _**thanks**_ to all for your continued support!
In this post we would like to highlight a few of those.

### Global Tool

Cake is now available as a global .NET CLI tool.
This means you can easily install Cake and have it globally available in your environment using the `dotnet tool` command.

```
dotnet tool install -g Cake.Tool --version 0.30.0
```

Once installed, you can launch `cake` from anywhere using the .NET CLI
```
dotnet cake build.cake
```

Which means you can now easily bootstrap the installation of Cake, if you have .NET Core SDK version 2.1.400 or newer installed.
Existing boostrappers will still work as we created a new NuGet package for the tool, which means we now have the following packages for Cake:

* [Cake](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake) - compiled for .NET 4.6.1 / Mono
* [Cake.CoreCLR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.CoreCLR) - compiled for .NET Core 2.0
* [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool) - .NET tool compiled for .NET Core 2.1

### Updated NuGet client

NuGet client assemblies have been updated to latest stable, this resolves issues with signed NuGet packages which could cause Cake to hang while acquiring tools and addins from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

### Collection initializers

Setting classes collection properties have been overhauled and refactored to enable initializer syntax. Might seem small, but it's really convenient, it makes
```csharp
new FooToolSettings
{
   EnvironmentVariables = new Dictionary<string, string> { ["FOO"] = "foo" }
}
```
become
```csharp
new FooToolSettings
{
    EnvironmentVariables = { ["FOO"] = "foo" }
}
```
