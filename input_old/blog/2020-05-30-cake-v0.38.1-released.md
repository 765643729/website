Version 0.38.1 of Cake has been released.

In this version we are releasing a small bug fix which was identified quite quickly after the release of 0.38.0.

We obsoleted a property within Cake, and a warning regarding this was being shown in the build output, even if you weren't using this property.

Contributions were included from:
