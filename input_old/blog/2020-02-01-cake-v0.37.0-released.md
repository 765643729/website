🎉 But first we would like to share a small milestone, [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/), the .NET Global tool version of Cake script runner, has now been downloaded over one million times from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/), we've seen some real uptake lately and are really excited about that.
[Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/) has some nice additions, C# 8 support being one of the biggest.

🍰Huge thanks to our community! It wouldn't have been possible without your support and contributions!❤
