Version 0.34.0 of Cake has been released.

First we would like to say a delayed happy birthday to Cake, in May it was five years since the first release of Cake.

It's been a great journey building a truly fully cross platform and cross environment build system, utilizing the power of C# and .NET giving the same experience regardless of running locally, running on build server, in a container, on .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono etc.

This journey wouldn't have been possible without an amazing community of contributors and users, we're really thankful for your support and we're just amazed with the fact that the runtime has been downloaded over five million times on NuGet, Docker Hub, Chocolatey and Homebrew.

We are no way near the end of the journey and believe it or not there's great progress on version 1.0, you can follow the work on version 1.0 in [this pr](https://github.com/cake-build/cake/pull/2334).

In this version we've several features, improvements and bug fixes, full details below but a few highlights in this release:

* Improved MSBuild 16 (VS2019) tool resolution
* Update to Roslyn version 3.0.0
* Updated to NuGet client version 5
* NuGet pack support for several new nuspec elements
