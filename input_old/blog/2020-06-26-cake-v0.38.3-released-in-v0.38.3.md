title: Cake v0.38.3 and v0.38.4 released
category: Release Notes

Version 0.38.3 of Cake has been released...in 0.38.4.

Because of a configuration error the hot fixes didn't go into 0.38.3, we corrected this in 0.38.4.

In this version, we are releasing two bug fixes that were identified after shipping our 0.38.2 release.
One is a fix for how braces are escaped in console messages and the other is ensuring valid dates in zip files.
