Version 0.38.2 of Cake has been released.

In this version we are releasing a small bug fix which was identified after shipping our 0.38.0 release.

One of the new features that shipped in 0.38.0 was support for ANSI escape codes.  Turns out, this feature breaks the service message logging in some CI systems.  The problem was identified when Cake was running in TeamCity, but it is possible that other systems are affected.
