Version 0.28.1 of Cake has been released.

After releasing version 0.28.0 we detected that tasks with multiple criterias were
written multiple times to the log and that certain messages from the NuGet integration
had too high verbosity for certain types of messages.

In other words nothing serious, but if the task log suddenly irritates you as much as
it did me, it might be worth bumping your 
[pinned version](https://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/pinning-cake-version) to 0.28.1.
