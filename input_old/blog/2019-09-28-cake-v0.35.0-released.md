<!--excerpt-->

### .NET Core 3 support

[Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/0.35.0) is now, in addition to .NET Core 2.1, also compiled for .NET Core 3.0 using .NET Core 3 RTM SDK.

This means Cake is built and tested to be able to run without modification in a pure .NET Core 3 environment.

#### Installing Cake.Tool

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Cake.Tool --version 0.35.0
```

#### Executing Cake.Tool

```bash
dotnet cake build.cake
```

### C# 8

Cake now ships with Roslyn 3.3.1, which will provide [C# 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8) support in your Cake scripts when running [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/0.35.0) on .NET Core 3.

#### Example C# 8

```csharp
// Switch expression
static string ToLevel(this Verbosity verbosity)
    => verbosity switch
    {
        Verbosity.Diagnostic    => "[****]",
        Verbosity.Verbose       => "[*** ]",
        Verbosity.Normal        => "[**  ]",
        Verbosity.Minimal       => "[*   ]",
        Verbosity.Quiet         => "[    ]",
         _  => throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(message: "invalid enum value",
            actualValue: verbosity,
            paramName: nameof(verbosity)),
    };

Verbosity[] verbosities = null;

// Null-coalescing assignment
verbosities ??= (Verbosity[])Enum.GetValues(typeof(Verbosity));

// Range last 4
foreach(Verbosity verbosity in verbosities[^4..])
{
    Information(
        "{0} = {1:F}",
        verbosity.ToLevel(),
        verbosity
        );
}
```

#### Output

```bash
[*   ] = Minimal
[**  ] = Normal
[*** ] = Verbose
[****] = Diagnostic
```

### Runtime identification & compiler constants

Runtime identification and detection has been improved, so now Cake will not just compile scripts as .NET Standard but the actual .NET Core runtime it's running under. This for example means Cake can now fully utilize a NuGet package compiled for .NET Core 3.

As Cake will now have different language features depending on which .NET Framework / Runtime it's running under we've introduced the same preprocessor symbols you generally get in regular C# with one Cake specific addition.

| Symbols          | Framework               | Cake Runner                                                     |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NET461`         | .NET Framework and Mono | [Cake](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake/0.35.0)              |
| `NETCOREAPP2_0`  | .NET Core 2.0           | [Cake.CoreCLR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core/0.35.0) |
| `NETCOREAPP2_1`  | .NET Core 2.1           | [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/0.35.0)    |
| `NETCOREAPP2_2`  | .NET Core 2.2           | [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/0.35.0)    |
| `NETCOREAPP3_0`  | .NET Core 3.0           | [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/0.35.0)    |
| `NETSTANDARD2_0` | .NET Standard           | default for unknown / new runtimes                              |
| `NETCOREAPP`     | .NET Core (any version) | [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/0.35.0) / [Cake.CoreCLR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core/0.35.0) |
| `NETFRAMEWORK`   | .NET Framework and Mono | [Cake](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake/0.35.0)              |
| `CAKE`           | Executing with Cake     | [Cake](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake/0.35.0) / [Cake.Tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/0.35.0) / [Cake.CoreCLR](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Core/0.35.0) |

This lets you if needed detect and adapt script based on runtime at script compile time.

#### Example Usage

```c#
#if (CAKE)
    Information("Running on Cake.");
#else
    Console.WriteLine("Not running on Cake.");
#endif

#if NETFRAMEWORK
    Information("Running on .NET Framework.");
#elif NETCOREAPP
    Information("Running on .NET Core.");
#else
    Information("Running on something else.");
#endif

#if NETCOREAPP3_0
    Information("Running on .NET Core 3.0.");
#endif
```
