<!--excerpt-->

### Typed context

In previous versions of Cake you've had to rely on global variables or static members to share variables/state between tasks; this leads to unnecessary complexity and hard to maintain code.

In this release we have introduced the concept of typed context, where in the `Setup` method you can create and return a class; this object is then available to be used in `Teardown` method, Task actions and criteria.

The class can be any C# class, as it's just standard C# you can provide `get` & `set` for properties you want to be mutable, and only get for read only properties.

```csharp
public class MyBuildData
{
	public string Configuration { get; }
	public bool SignAssemblies { get; }
	public bool AssmbliesSigned { get; set; }

	public MyBuildData(
		string configuration,
		bool signAssemblies)
	{
		Configuration = configuration;
		SignAssemblies = signAssemblies;
	}
}
```

Providing your script with a typed context is done by returning an instance of a class from your script `Setup` method.

```csharp
Setup<MyBuildData>(setupContext =>
{
	return new MyBuildData(
		configuration: Argument("configuration", "Release"),
		signAssemblies: BuildSystem.IsRunningOnAppVeyor);
});
```

Accessing your data in your task action and criteria, is then done by supplying a type parameter to your task `Does` / `DoesForEach` / `WithCriteria` methods.

```csharp
Task("Sign")
    .WithCriteria<MyBuildData>((context, data) => data.SignAssemblies)
    .Does<MyBuildData>(data =>
{
      data.AssmbliesSigned = true;
});
```

And it's then done in a similar way with your script `Teardown` method.

```csharp
Teardown<MyBuildData>((teardownContext, data) =>
{
    if (data.AssmbliesSigned)
    {
        Information("Assemblies were signed");
    }
    else
    {
        Information("Assemblies were NOT signed");
    }
});
```

### Setup context

This release changed the script Setup context from a `ICakeContext` to `ISetupContext`. In addition to everything that `ICakeContext` offers, there is now some additional information provided:

```csharp
ICakeTaskInfo TargetTask { get; }
IReadOnlyCollection<ICakeTaskInfo> TasksToExecute { get; }
```

`TargetTask` is the task that initiated the script and `TasksToExecute` are the tasks that will be executed based on the dependency graph of the target task. Access to which tasks actually will be executed has been a greatly sought after feature, combined with the typed context makes it fairly straightforward to enable some advanced scenarios.

```csharp
Setup<MyBuildData>(setupContext =>
{
	var signAssemblies = BuildSystem.IsRunningOnAppVeyor
							|| StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase.Equals("Sign", setupContext.TargetTask.Name);

	var isPublishBuild = setupContext
                          .TasksToExecute
                          .Where(task => StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase.Equals("Publish", task.Name))
                          .Any();

    return new MyBuildData (
    	configuration: Argument("configuration", "Release"),
    	signAssemblies: signAssemblies,
        isPublishBuild: isPublishBuild);
});
```

In the above code we choose to sign assemblies if either running on AppVeyor or the script initiating target is `Sign`. And we'll treat build as a "publish" build if any of the depending tasks is named `Publish`.

### Criteria messages

Task `WithCriteria` can now have a message that's outputted when a task is skipped, this will make it clearer in the log why a specific task wasn't executed.

This means by doing

```csharp
Task("Sign")
    .WithCriteria<MyBuildData>(
        (context, data) => data.SignAssemblies,
        "Sign skipped because SignAssemblies is set to false."
        );
```

the verbose output goes from

```
========================================
Sign
========================================
Skipping task: Sign
```

to

```
========================================
Sign
========================================
Skipping task: Sign skipped because SignAssemblies is set to false.
```

### Potentially breaking

When we have to ship a breaking change in Cake, one piece of feedback that we have often heard is that it can be very frustrating to have a build suddenly fail, due to a new dependency on a higher version of `Cake.Core`. We have always advocated that all builds should be pinned to a specific version of Cake, so that a new breaking change does not affect your builds, however, we also understand that some people want to run their builds this way.

In this release we've introduced the notion of a "Potentially breaking change", which is when we've refactored code we will not break the build, but issue a warning but not break the build.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1647294/40666343-be1311e8-635f-11e8-8748-8ea49c02b927.png)

In the case that we find that a change will break addins, then we'll issue a hotfix and then set the minimal required version of `Cake.Core` and break the build.

This means even though we made some substantial changes, version `0.28.0` will still have `0.26.0` as the minimal required version for Cake addins to target.

We believe this compromise will minimize end user frustration - while still keeping the risk of runtime errors low.


### Issues & workarounds

In this release we've refactored some internals of Cake, while most scripts with just continue to work without issue, there are some that will need to be tweaked.

- `CakeTaskBuilder<ActionTask>` has been refactored to `CakeTaskBuilder`, this means scripts that use and store `CakeTaskBuilder<ActionTask>` like i.e. [Cake.Recipe](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.Recipe) will need to replace all instances of `CakeTaskBuilder<ActionTask>` to  `CakeTaskBuilder`.
- `ActionTask` is removed in favor of just using `CakeTask`, this to reduce complexity and simplify future features.
- `ICakeContext` interface now has a `ICakeDataResolver` `Data` property that needs to be implemented.
- Setup as gone from `Action<ICakeContext>` to `Action<ISetupContext>`.
