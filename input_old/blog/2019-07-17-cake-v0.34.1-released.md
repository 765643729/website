Version 0.34.1 of Cake has been released.

This is just a minor release as a hotfix to address an issue breaking scripts when the dynamic C# keyword was used in build scripts. This was a side effect of updating from Roslyn 2.x to 3.x.

Thanks [dieterv](https://github.com/dieterv) for reporting! All contributions are appreciated❤.

BTW this is the 100th Cake release! 🎉
