title: Cake v0.32.0 released
category: Release Notes

Version 0.32.0 of Cake has been released.

This is the first release for 2019, but before we focus on the new, a short retrospect of 2018.
In 2018 we had 11 releases of Cake, hundreds of PRs from over fifty individual contributors, hundreds of issues raised and closed, and millions of downloads.
All in all, it sums up to an active and healthy community – which we’re very grateful for, thank you!

A trend we saw in 2018 was that more and more tools start to come as .NET Global tools (including Cake itself) and most of these have been added to Cake tool resolution, allowing you with minimal changes run in a pure .NET Core environment.

This release has several improvements and fixes, to note a few, Cake’s Zip archive functionality has been greatly improved, initial support for VS2019 / MSBuild 16 has been added, a complete list of changes can be found below.

Happy New Year!

**Known issue**

 * Chocolatey pack has a regression in this release, we'll try to release a hotfix 0.32.1 as soon as possible.
