### Exclusive

When you've executed a series of tasks and it fails on the last one, wouldn't it be nice if you could execute a single task, without requiring all of its dependencies to execute again? Well you're in luck, this just got added into 0.29.0! Beyond retrying failed operations - this can really speed things up while developing and debugging a script.

Below is a simple script with two tasks where `Dependent-Task` depends on `Dependency-Task`.

```csharp
var target = Argument("target", "Default");

Task("Dependency-Task")
    .Does(() =>
{
    Information("Executing dependency.");
});


Task("Dependent-Task")
    .IsDependentOn("Dependency-Task")
    .Does(() =>
{
   Information("Executing task.");
});

RunTarget(target);
```

Normally when executing `Cake.exe --target="Dependent-Task"` we would see something like:
```
========================================
Dependency-Task
========================================
Executing dependency.

========================================
Dependent-Task
========================================
Executing task.

Task                          Duration
--------------------------------------------------
Dependency-Task               00:00:00.0061407
Dependent-Task                00:00:00.0002070
--------------------------------------------------
Total:                        00:00:00.0063477
```

But when specifying the `exclusive` option `Cake.exe --target="Dependent-Task" --exclusive`, then only the specified task will execute.

```
========================================
Dependent-Task
========================================
Executing task.

Task                          Duration
--------------------------------------------------
Dependent-Task                00:00:00.0059713
--------------------------------------------------
Total:                        00:00:00.0059713
```
